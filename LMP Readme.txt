Installation:

---------------------

Client side:
- Copy the contents of the folder LMPClient to KSP folder. So in KSP/GameData folder you have a "LunaMultiPlayer" folder

DO NOT put LMPServer or LMPMasterServer in your GameData folder!!!

Server side:
- Copy the dolfer LMPServer to any folder of your choice EXCEPT the KSP folder. Put it preferably on C:/ or in your desktop

--------------------

You won't need LMPMasterServer unless you're a designated host.

Remember: CAREER or SCIENCE modes are NOT supported.
Also, we cannot provide support for other mods in a multiplayer environment so if you have other mods besides LMP expect issues!
