First of all you need the Tools for Unity extension (also free). Get the one for your VS version and install it.

1- Copy KSP_x64_Dbg.exe to your KSP directory (example: D:\Steam\SteamApps\common\Kerbal Space Program\)

2- Open a command prompt in that directory (shift right clic in the empty space of the explorer and select "open command window here". In it enter the command "mklink /J KSP_x64_Dbg_Data KSP_x64_Data". 
   You will now have a KSP_x64_Dbg_Data that points to the stock KSP_x64_Data.

3- Put the PlayerConnectionConfigFile in the KSP_x64_Data directory (it makes the mono debugger starts its listening port)

4- Launch KSP with the KSP_x64_Dbg.exe

5- Attach to the correct unity instance using the Debug->Attach to unity debugger option from Visual studio
